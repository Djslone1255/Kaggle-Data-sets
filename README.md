# Overview

this data set had a list of crabs and contained data on  the size, weight and age of said crabs https://www.kaggle.com/sidhus/crab-age-prediction

my goal was to learn about analyzing data using Python Pandas, while I accomplished that, I primarily learn how little I understand 
Data Analzing.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}
